ESP-01 Serial to Web Server with Terminal Emulation
Overview

This firmware transforms an ESP-01 module into a web-accessible serial terminal gateway, providing real-time bidirectional communication between a web interface and a connected serial device. The solution is designed for professional embedded systems management, remote debugging, and headless device administration.
Key Features

    Web-based Serial Terminal: Full duplex communication via modern web browser

    ANSI Terminal Emulation: Basic support for ANSI control sequences and colors

    User Friendly UI UI: Clean, responsive interface suitable for production environments

    Complete Serial Configuration:

        Adjustable baud rate (300-115200)

        Configurable data bits (5-8)

        Selectable parity (none, even, odd)

        Stop bits configuration (1-2)

    Control Key Support:

        Full CTRL key combinations (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+S, etc.)

        Arrow key emulation

        Special function keys

    Enterprise-Ready Architecture:

        Efficient data buffering

        Memory-optimized operation

        Stable connection handling

Hardware Requirements

    ESP-01 (ESP8266) module

    3.3V USB-to-Serial adapter (for programming)

    Target serial device (connected to ESP-01's UART)

Installation

    Compile and Upload:

        Use Arduino IDE with ESP8266 core installed

        Select "Generic ESP8266 Module" as board

        Set appropriate flash size (1MB recommended)

        Upload the compiled firmware

    Initial Configuration:

        The device will connect to the configured WiFi network on startup

        Default credentials are set in the code (change before production deployment)

    Accessing the Interface:

        Connect to the same network as the ESP-01

        Access the web interface via the device's assigned IP

        No authentication layer is implemented

Usage Instructions
Terminal Interface

    The main interface provides a scrollable terminal emulator

    Input field at bottom sends data when Enter is pressed

    Control buttons provide quick access to common control sequences

Settings Configuration

    Access settings via the "Serial Settings" link

    Adjust parameters as needed for your target device

    Changes take effect immediately upon saving

Keyboard Shortcuts

    Ctrl+C: Send break signal (0x03)

    Ctrl+D: Send EOF (0x04)

    Ctrl+X: Cancel operation (0x18)

    Ctrl+S: Stop transmission (0x13)

    Ctrl+Z: Suspend (0x1A)

    Arrow Keys: Send ANSI navigation sequences

Security Considerations

    Change Default Credentials: Modify WiFi credentials before deployment

    Network Isolation: Place on secured network segment for your safety

    HTTPS: Not Avaible

Limitations

    Memory constraints limit buffer size (adjust maxBufferSize as needed)

    Not all ANSI sequences are fully implemented

    No persistent connection recovery mechanism

    WebSocket implementation would improve performance (not included)

Maintenance

    Firmware Updates: Regularly check for security updates to ESP8266 core

    Monitoring: Implement external monitoring for connection stability

    Logging: Add remote logging for troubleshooting if needed

Commercial Deployment Notes

    Custom Branding: Modify HTML/CSS to reflect your corporate identity

    Legal Compliance: Ensure solution meets local wireless regulations

    Support: Plan for ongoing maintenance and user support

    Documentation: Supplement this README with specific deployment guides
